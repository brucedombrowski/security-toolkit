# QuickStart Config: Example Project Template
# ============================================================================
#
# Copy this file and customize it for your project:
#
#   cp example_project.conf my_project.conf
#   # Edit settings below
#   ./QuickStart.sh my_project.conf
#
# This config defines your target, credentials, which scans to run, and
# how aggressive each scan should be. Once configured, scans are repeatable
# and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines with the -n (non-interactive) flag.
#
# See also:
#   demo_target.conf  — Optimized for live demos (fast, visible results)
#   lab_target.conf   — Full coverage for QA testing (slow, thorough)

# ── Target Information ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# SCAN_TYPE: What are you scanning?
#   "host" = A machine/server (vulnerability assessment, security config)
#   "repo" = A directory of files (PII, secrets, malware, sensitive data)
#
SCAN_TYPE=host

# TARGET_HOST: IP address or hostname of the machine to scan.
#   For "repo" scans, this is ignored — you'll specify a directory path instead.
#   Examples: 192.168.1.100, 10.0.0.50, myserver.internal.company.com
#
TARGET_HOST=192.168.1.100

# TARGET_LOCATION: Is the target this machine or a remote system?
#   "local"  = Scan this machine (no SSH needed)
#   "remote" = Scan over SSH
#
TARGET_LOCATION=remote

# AUTH_MODE: How do we access the target?
#   "credentialed"   = SSH login for deep inspection (host config, Lynis, ClamAV)
#   "uncredentialed" = Network-only scan (nmap ports/services, no login required)
#
# Use "uncredentialed" when:
#   - You don't have SSH access to the target
#   - The target is a Windows machine without SSH
#   - You only need a network-level assessment
#
AUTH_MODE=credentialed

# REMOTE_USER: SSH username on the target.
#   This user needs sudo access for Lynis and ClamAV scans.
#   Ignored if AUTH_MODE=uncredentialed or TARGET_LOCATION=local.
#
REMOTE_USER=admin

# PROJECT_NAME: Label that appears in reports, attestations, and filenames.
#   Use something meaningful — this is what auditors see.
#   Examples: "Production-Web-01", "Staging-DB", "CI-Runner-03"
#
PROJECT_NAME="My Project Server"


# ── Skip Interactive Menus ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# When true, QuickStart uses the scan selections below instead of prompting.
# Set to false if you want the interactive menu with these as defaults.
#
SKIP_SCAN_SELECTION=true


# ── Network Scans (nmap) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# These run from the SCANNER machine against the target over the network.
# No SSH access required.
#
# RUN_NMAP_PORTS: Basic port scan — which ports are open?
#   NIST Control: RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning)
#   Fast, low impact. Almost always enable this.
#
RUN_NMAP_PORTS=true

# RUN_NMAP_SERVICES: Service version detection (-sV)
#   Probes open ports to identify what software is running and its version.
#   Example output: "22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.9p1"
#   Adds ~30 sec per host. Recommended for identifying outdated software.
#
RUN_NMAP_SERVICES=true

# RUN_NMAP_OS: OS fingerprinting (-O)
#   Attempts to identify the target's operating system.
#   ⚠ Requires root/sudo on the SCANNER (not the target).
#   Set to false if you don't run QuickStart as root.
#
RUN_NMAP_OS=false

# RUN_NMAP_VULN: Vulnerability scripts (--script vuln)
#   Runs nmap's built-in vulnerability detection scripts against open services.
#   Produces CVE references that feed into the KEV check.
#   Adds 1-5 minutes. Enable for security assessments, disable for quick checks.
#
RUN_NMAP_VULN=true


# ── SSH/Credentialed Host Scans ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# These require SSH access to the target. They log in and inspect the system
# from inside. Ignored if AUTH_MODE=uncredentialed.
#
# RUN_HOST_INVENTORY: System component inventory
#   NIST Control: CM-8 (System Component Inventory)
#   Collects: OS version, CPU, RAM, disk, network interfaces, installed packages.
#   ⚠ Output is marked CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information).
#   Fast (~10 sec). Enable for compliance baselines.
#
RUN_HOST_INVENTORY=true

# RUN_HOST_SECURITY: Security configuration check
#   NIST Control: CM-6 (Configuration Settings)
#   Checks: SSH config, firewall rules, listening services, user accounts, sudo.
#   Fast (~15 sec). Finds common misconfigurations.
#
RUN_HOST_SECURITY=true

# RUN_HOST_POWER: Power/sleep settings check
#   Checks if the system can sleep/hibernate (risk for always-on servers).
#   Fast (~5 sec). Disable for virtual machines or containers.
#
RUN_HOST_POWER=false

# RUN_HOST_LYNIS: Lynis security audit
#   NIST Control: CA-2 (Security Assessments)
#   Comprehensive security hardening assessment with a 0-100 score.
#   Requires Lynis installed on the target (toolkit will offer to install it).
#   LYNIS_MODE controls depth:
#     "quick" = ~2 minutes, skips long-running tests
#     "full"  = ~10-15 minutes, complete assessment
#
RUN_HOST_LYNIS=true
LYNIS_MODE=quick

# RUN_HOST_MALWARE: ClamAV malware scan
#   NIST Control: SI-3 (Malicious Code Protection)
#   Scans target filesystem for malware signatures.
#   Requires ClamAV installed on the target (toolkit will offer to install it).
#
#   MALWARE_SCAN_PATHS controls what gets scanned:
#     "/home /tmp /var /opt"  = Application/user directories (~30 sec)
#     "/var/www /opt/myapp"   = Just your application directories
#     "/"                     = Full filesystem (5-15 min, thorough)
#
RUN_HOST_MALWARE=true
MALWARE_SCAN_PATHS="/home /tmp /var /opt"

# RUN_HOST_KEV: CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities cross-reference
#   NIST Control: RA-5, SI-5 (Vulnerability Monitoring / Security Alerts)
#   Cross-references CVEs found by nmap against CISA's KEV catalog.
#   ⚠ Requires RUN_NMAP_VULN=true to produce CVE data.
#   Fast (~5 sec). Enable for federal compliance (BOD 22-01).
#
RUN_HOST_KEV=true
